(** To use these classes, inherit from them and override the methods corresponding to the
    types from [Parsetree] you want to process. For instance to collect all the string
    constants in a structure:

    {[
      let string_constants_of = object
        inherit [string list] Ast_traverse.fold as super

        method! expression e acc =
          let acc = super#expression e acc in
          match e.pexp_desc with
          | Pexp_constant (Const_string (s, _)) -> s :: acc
          | _ -> acc

        method! pattern p acc =
          let acc = super#pattern p acc in
          match p.ppat_desc with
          | Ppat_constant (Const_string (s, _)) -> s :: acc
          | _ -> acc
      end

      let string_constants_of_structure = string_constants_of#structure
    ]}
